        From your class's data, you determined that the most likely value for the age of the universe was: <StudentResponse class="StudentResponses">{{ state.age_calc_state.best_guess }}</StudentResponse>&nbsp;Gyr, with a confidence interval from <StudentResponse class="StudentResponses">{{ state.age_calc_state.low_guess }}</StudentResponse>&nbsp;to <StudentResponse class="StudentResponses">{{ state.age_calc_state.high_guess }}</StudentResponse>&nbsp;Gyr.

                    Sometimes, the mean, median, and mode of a distribution all have the same value. That value would be a strong candidate for being the most likely value based on the distribution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the values do not agree, you can choose any of the mean, median or mode, or even something different, as long as you justify why you chose it. You can review what each quantity represents and when scientists might use it by clicking the <v-icon>mdi-help-circle-outline</v-icon> next to it.

                    The range you pick will have a tradeoff between how likely it is that the “true” value actually lies within the range you choose vs. having a narrow enough range that your measurement is actually useful. A very large range is more likely to include the "true" value, but may be so nonspecific that it is not useful. A narrow range has more specificity but may not include the "true" value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Different people will feel more or less comfortable with the different sides of this tradeoff, and there isn’t really a right or wrong answer as long as you justify why you
                    chose what you did.
                  </p>

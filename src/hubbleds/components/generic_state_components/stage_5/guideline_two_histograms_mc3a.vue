      Perhaps even more important than the range of ages is <strong>how those ages are distributed</strong>. If most of the measurements are bunched closely together, that gives us more confidence than
      if they are spread across a large range of values or are bunched around multiple values. As with the dot plots you saw earlier, more <strong>consensus</strong> in measurements generally gives us more <strong>confidence</strong> in a result.

        In the upper graph we show the distribution of first measurements as you saw earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the lower graph, we show the distribution of second distance measurements. Yours are again marked in red-orange.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on these two histograms, which set of measurements shows better consensus on the distance to the galaxy?
